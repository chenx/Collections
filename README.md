-------------
The smallest chess game (2015), in 487 bytes, breaks 32-year-old record of the 1K ZX Chess (1983, Sinclair ZX81). Capable of running on Windows, Linux, OS X, and BSD due to the way in which it was implemented.

<a href="https://github.com/chenx/Collections/tree/master/C/cmockery-0.1.2">CMockery</a>
-------------------------
A light-weighted C unit test framework. Independ from other open source package. Non-invasive for the code to be tested. Less than 3000 lines of C. Avoid complex compiler feature, so compatible with older versions of compilers. Does not require tested code to conform to C99 standard, thus useful to embed applications.
